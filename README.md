## Introduce

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.pinp.me/www/www/">PINP</a> (*PINP Is Not PPT*) is PPT-like presentation system which is based on HTML5/CSS3.

PINP also supports <a target="_blank" href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> blog writing, any slide page can embed into a blog. So, PINP blog is simple since *markdown* syntax is simple, on the other hand, it is powerful for embedding of slide page, <a target="_blank" href="//best-js.github.io/blog/$$English/1.online_blog.blog/">see sample document</a>.

&nbsp;

## How it works?

PINP blog system is depend on the features of <a target="_blank" href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>, in one word, when you create a public repository in github.com and set `gh-pages` as default branch, you can visit your static web files (such as html, css, js, etc) by URL `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/index.html`, there is one thing important, github pages is **free**!

When static web files are organized as PINP DOC required, they would served as PINP blog and PINP slide. The blog homepage will list all published PINP documents, it come with **online editor** and **offline editor** also.

The homepage of PINP blog <a target="target" href="//best-js.github.io/blog/?opendoc=%2F%2Fbest-js.github.io%2Fblog%2F%24%24English%2F0.netlog.blog%2F">looks like this</a>.

## Build a free blog system in github

It sounds good, so, how to build one for myself? Please follow next 3 steps:

 > Open github repository: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pinp/software">pinp/software</a>, then click **Fork** button to clone it to your account. Then, select `software/blogger10.json` file and edit it, set the value of `home_repository` to `blog`, as following diagram.   
![config blogger10.json](pages/config_root.png)   
The value "`blog`" is another repository which will be cloned at next step, it use for denoting which is root blog, then, click **Commit changes** button to apply the modification.

Warning: you should modify yourself's `blogger10.json` which is forked from `pinp/software`, i.e. modify the file in `<username>/software/` folder, not the one in `pinp/software/`.

&nbsp;

Step 3: Fork blog repository (i.e. pinp/blog)   
 > Open github repository: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pinp/blog">pinp/blog</a>, click **Fork** button to clone it to your account. Then, select `blog/config.json` file and edit it, set the value of `user_name` to your registed username, set the value of `repos_name` to `blog`, as following diagram (suppose your username is `best-js`).   
![config config.json](pages/config_blog.png)   
Next, click **Commit changes** button to apply the modification.

Warning: you should modify yourself's `config.json` which is forked from `pinp/blog`, i.e. modify the file in `<username>/blog/` folder, not the one in `pinp/blog/`.
